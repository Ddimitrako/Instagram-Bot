# Purpose of the project 
The purpose of this project is to auto comment in instagram
giveaway-competitions an win some maximize the posibilitie to win. The bot starts by reading a comments.txt file where we have stored all of our comments. Then it opens Mozilla Firefox an connect to the Instagram with our account password and name. Finally it goes to the aproprate Instagram link we have set in the bot code and start commenting. This bot has also a smart way to stop instagram from blocking the bot comments after they are spammed continiusly. It uses an increasingly random time algorithm between comments so this way it can extend its operation time.
